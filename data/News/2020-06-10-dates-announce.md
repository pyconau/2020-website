We’re excited to officially announce the dates for PyConline AU 2020, which will be held as a virtual event on September 4-6 2020!

This year will be a little different compared to what we’re familiar with, and we’ll miss seeing all your faces in person. With that in mind, the organising team are extremely conscious of creating a fun, safe and educational environment where the Python community in Australia can come together online. PyConline AU won’t just be a playlist of talks—we want this to be a community event that everyone can participate in and enjoy.

<p>
    Like you, we have lots of questions in our head about what PyConline AU will be like as a virtual event. We don’t yet have all the answers! That said, here’s a few guiding points that we’re focused on.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specialist tracks are still important—they’re a home for many parts of the Python community in Australia and beyond, and there were some fantastic proposals for specialist tracks that we’re excited to share with the world. Specialist tracks will remain a part of our virtual experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        Community is key, we want this to be a safe, inviting space for the community to connect—not just watch talks remotely. The organising team is formed from members of the community, and just as it is for many of you, the community is important to us. We’re still working out the details, but it’s high amongst our priorities.
    </li>
    <li>
        We care about having a diverse and inclusive event, and this is front and centre of the organising teams work. With more details to come with the CFP announcement, we will continue to actively support first time speakers, and welcome new members of the Python community to be a part of our online conference.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alongside this news post, we’ll be doing an announcement stream tonight, 10 June at 7:30pm ACST (that’s UTC+0930). The video feed will be embedded shortly thereafter at the top of this announcement post.
</p>

<h2>Call for proposals (CFP)</h2>
<p>
    PyConline AU’s call for proposals will open soon (we’re aiming for within a week) and be open for until the end of June. A separate, official announcement post will announce the Specialist Tracks, the CFP details, and how to submit your proposals.  Between now and then, start thinking about what interesting topics you might like to present at PyConline AU in September.

<h2>
    Sponsorships
</h2>
<p>
    While we no longer have a hefty conference centre expense, a high quality virtual event does not run without costs. We’re still seeking sponsorships for this year’s PyConline AU event. If your employer, or someone in your network is in a position to sponsor PyConline AU we’d love to have a chat about making it a truly impactful experience. Head on over to our <a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/sponsor">sponsor page</a> for more details.

    Stay safe,<br>
