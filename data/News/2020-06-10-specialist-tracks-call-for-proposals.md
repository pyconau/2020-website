Starting today, PyConline AU’s 2020 call for proposals (CFP) will be open for submissions running all month until **12 July, anywhere on earth (UTC+12)**. Alongside this announcement, we’re also officially publishing our specialist tracks.

## Specialist tracks
Historically at PyCon AU, we dedicate a day to our specialist tracks, and PyConline AU will be similar again this year. These are focused, themed “mini-conferences” that are curated by members of the community.
We’re excited to share that after receiving several proposals for specialist tracks, this year we will have five fantastic tracks:

* DjangoCon Australia
* Security and Privacy
* Education
* Data Science & Analytics
* DevOops: Learning from Failure

You can learn more about the specialist tracks and their topics on our updated program page at [https://2020.pycon.org.au/program](https://2020.pycon.org.au/program).

## Call for proposals (CFP)
Today we are also opening our CFP!
Submissions to speak at PyConline AU 2020 will be accepted from now until **12 July, anywhere on earth (UTC+12)**. For those of you in Adelaide Australia that is 9:30pm the day after.


We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:
who have never given a conference talk before,
who are new to Python,
who have built interesting things in Python, 
who have helped build Python, and
who have expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

If you’ve never presented at a conference before and you think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! PyConline AU actively welcomes and encourages new speakers to the conference. As with prior years, we will have speaking mentors on hand to work with you to develop your proposal and talk content so that you can give the best talk possible.

Our CFP process also encompasses submissions to the five specialist tracks (announced above). You can submit your talk to the main conference and the specialist tracks with one click.
