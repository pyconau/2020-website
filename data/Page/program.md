# Program

## Specialist tracks

Specialist tracks are focused, themed “mini-conferences” that are curated by members of the community. This year we will have five fantastic tracks:

* **DjangoCon Australia**: returning for their eighth year, this track is all things Django. Stories and fairy tales about Django, web development in Python, ponies, and unicorns 🦄!
* **Security and Privacy**: How (and why) to be safe on the Big, Scary Internet, and avoid being the next headline data breach.
* **Education**: Learn about learning, teach about teaching, and educate about education
* **Science, Data, & Analytics**: Data and number crunching, analysis and visualisation, machine learning, and how those things affect us human beings.
* **DevOops: Learning from Failure**: as their inaugural PyConline appearance. “Learn from our failures, or teach us about yours”.

PyConline AU's call for proposals will encompass submissions to all Specialist Tracks. You can submit your talk to the main conference and the specialist tracks with one click.

To learn more about the submitting to a specialist track, [check out our CFP](/speak).
