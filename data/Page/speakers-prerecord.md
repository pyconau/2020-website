# Information for pre-recording your talk

## Your options for pre-recording

If you want to pre-record, you have two options:

- **Pre-record by yourself**. This is the way to go if you want the best video and audio quality, if you don't want a dodgy Internet connection causing problems, or if you want to do something different and interesting with your video.
- **Apply for a slot to pre-record with our help**. We'll use roughly the same tools as we use on the day, but we'll record the output earlier and play it back. The quality will be the same as a livestream, and your Internet connection will still need to be up to scratch.  Limited slots are available, so not everyone that wants to do this will be able to.

Either way, **you need to let us know before 15 August** through Pretalx. If you [edit your accepted submission](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/), you'll see a question you can use to indicate your preference. (This is *not* the same as the question that you were asked during the CFP process.)

With both options, we encourage you to invest time before your talk to ensure your recording setup is optimal (see below).  Clear audio especially will ensure your video is as engaging as possible, holding people’s attention for the duration of the talk.

### How much help will I get?

Our AV team and volunteers are able to provide tips and advice. However, in most cases we are unable to provide complex support, debug setups, or edit videos for you.

Some additional support is available for talks scheduled in the **Curlyboi Theatre** and the **Science and Data** track, however; the AV team will get in touch with you with more details.

## Technical requirements

- Video length: A **maximum** of the duration you selected&mdash;so either **15, 25 or 55 minutes**. It can run a little shorter but it **can not** run longer, even by a second.
- Resolution:1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720)
- We can handle format re-conversion, but preference for format is below.
- We will email out upload details to those who opt-in to this.
- No video intro or outro sequence needed&mdash;if you include one, it may be edited out.
- You must be available in the conference Venueless stage during your talk, so you can answer questions!
- Editing needs to be done by you, and requesting changes after the due date unlikely. The AV team is expecting to have many hours of video to work through so we likely will not have the capacity to do special pre-event edits ourselves.  You can however request an extension.
- The AV team will be in touch to help out for speakers in the **Curlyboi Theatre** and the **Science and Data** track, as we're expecting to help edit some videos for this track specifically.

### Preferred format

- Format: MP4 H.264 with AAC audio (Handbrake preset “Youtube HQ 1080 or 720”).
- Video Bitrate: At least 2.5mbit for 720p, 4mbit for 1080p.
- Audio Bitrate: At least 160kbit, mono or stereo.
- File size: Under 4GB
- Framerate: 30 (but 29.97/30/50/60 OK too; make sure your [lights don't flicker](http://urbanvideo.ca/avoid-video-flicker))
- Filename: should contain your name and title talk, i.e. MyTalkTitle_RyanVerner.mp4
- Where to upload to: URL will be emailed to you

NOTE: If you have multiple presenters, please submit a single video - A/V team has limited capacity for custom edits, we're expecting an edited video ready to broadcast.
