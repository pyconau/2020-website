abstract: <p>This talk will be an introduction and overview of these Graph databases
  that are so hot right now, and how you can drive them using python.</p>
description: "<p>Relational and NoSQL DBs have ruled the roost for a couple of decades\
  \ now, but in real life there's more to data than just tables or key-pairs. Graph\
  \ DBMS technology has been coming along for the last decade or so and is now quite\
  \ mature and everyone wants one (just ask a Fortune 500 company). </p>\n<p>I mean:\
  \ why have a table when you can have a knowledge graph? Why not be able to whip\
  \ up a recommendations engine (or indeed a fraud detector) in a few minutes?</p>\n\
  <p>Graph databases store data in Graphs -- that is NOT chart-visualisation nor syntax\
  \ standard on API layers (NOT a GraphQL talk), but per the paper written by the\
  \ mathematician Euler in 1736: those data structures which are \"nodes\" connected\
  \ by \"relationships\".</p>\n<p>This talk will be a primer on what this all means,\
  \ how they work and when they're a good idea to use. There will also be a demonstration\
  \ and discussion about how to kick off with graph DBs driven by python.</p>"
