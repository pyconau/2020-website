abstract: <p>This talk introduces the simple concepts of Lambda calculus with hands-on
  implementation of the application of the Lambda function with Python.  This talk
  will be helpful to students with background equivalent to undergraduate degrees
  in mathematics or computer science.</p>
description: "<p>We will be focusing on untyped lambda calculus and start by the simple\
  \ definition of a function, that can be implemented with Python lambda. We will\
  \ then discuss the concepts of <strong>abstraction</strong> and <strong>application</strong>\
  \ in lambda calculus and then move on to understand what a <strong>substitution</strong>\
  \ is and how can these be implemented in Python. We will finally study some combinators\
  \ which are the basic building blocks of combinatory logic, before ending with encoding\
  \ datatypes in lambda calculus and implementing the same with Python lambda. Datatypes\
  \ we will be discussing are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boolean values like TRUE and FALSE</li>\n\
  <li>Logical operators like AND, OR and NOT</li>\n<li>Church Numerals</li>\n<li>Predicates</li>\n\
  <li>Recursions</li>\n</ol>"
