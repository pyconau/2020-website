abstract: <p>I have a side project. It's a web app. It got popular.  Uh-oh.</p>
description: "<p>When you work for a company, you probably have a decent-sized infrastructure\
  \ budget. And when you're building a Django project, you have a lot of scope for\
  \ scaling it up: Add more gunicorn workers! Split the async task workers into their\
  \ own servers! Quadruple the RAM of the database instance! Beef up your Elasticache!</p>\n\
  <p>Okay, but what if you can't just throw your employers' money at it? What if,\
  \ to keep your side project affordable, you bought a reserved instance for it just\
  \ a week before it started to go viral? What if the number of users starts going\
  \ up 50% per week and... doesn't... stop...</p>\n<p>You're gonna have to get clever.</p>"
