abstract: <p>In this talk, we will deep dive into the world of Medical Imaging and
  Radiology, in particular. We will soar through the mighty oceans of various kinds
  of diseases and limitations of AI with the prevalent Deep Learning architectures
  which are at our disposal. At this point, we will also delve into the progress that
  has been made in the domain of integrative healthcare which is the amalgamation
  of AI and Medicine (and, pathology).</p>
description: "<p>Almost every individual today in the field of Data Science would\
  \ know about the concept of Ensemble Learning in ML (ideally, the last chapter we\
  \ read in the Machine Learning pedagogy). However, it is to also note that very\
  \ few literatures exists to ensemble Deep Neural Architectures. Therefore, this\
  \ is where we step forward and propose an approach to solve (almost) any medical\
  \ imaging problem with the means of our Ensemble approach. Our approach does not\
  \ just \"solve\" medical imaging problems but help practitioners to build unique\
  \ and seamless architectures that almost never goes wrong (at least, not on your\
  \ good days).</p>\n<p>Why use an Ensemble at all?</p>\n<p>In this section, I will\
  \ try to anticipate the common notions one would have while reading this proposal\
  \ and try to address the same in advance.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are brilliant\
  \ pre-trained architectures available and building up a custom CNN architecture\
  \ takes seconds today, right? Then, why take the extra headache of combining architectures\
  \ after all?</p>\n<p>I wanted to give you a solid reason why then I thought I'll\
  \ give you three:</p>\n<p>(1) Attaining state-of-the-art accuracy:</p>\n<p>To elucidate\
  \ on this, let's recall a very famous (or, infamous) chapter from our old books\
  \ on Elementary Statistics that is - Central Limit Theorem. This theorem gives us\
  \ two very important implications:</p>\n<p>There are two big implications of the\
  \ Central Limit theorem:</p>\n<p>Ensembles of many random processes/variables converge\
  \ to Gaussian distributions. That’s why normal distributions are everywhere.\nWhen\
  \ adding together random numbers, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances\
  \ of those numbers.\nWhich, in the essence of Machine/Deep Learning, translates\
  \ to the fact that when we combine n (number of) architectures together then the\
  \ combined architecture let's say, x will at all times produce better performance\
  \ or results on standard metrics that every individual model in the n-cluster of\
  \ models.</p>\n<p>A slight limitation:</p>\n<p>Central Limit Theorem also states\
  \ that no matter how many models one tries to Ensemble one can never reach the accuracy\
  \ of 1 (or, 100).</p>\n<p>But that's alright, I believe. We don't need to attain\
  \ a full 100% accuracy to prove the reliability of a model, do we?</p>\n<p>Furthermore,\
  \ we have proven this hypothesis of ours of attaining state-of-the-art accuracy\
  \ in our published works with regards to the same. Kindly, refer.</p>\n<p>(2) Model\
  \ Diversity: </p>\n<p>This is arguably the most important contribution of ours out\
  \ of all three which gives an indication of the reliability of our approach. Our\
  \ experiments (which are also included in our papers) also goes on to show how well\
  \ the architecture performs on external unseen examples - images which are not even\
  \ part of the dataset.</p>\n<p>Why is this important?</p>\n<p>Elementary. We are\
  \ dealing with Medical data where there is a plethora of possibilities, complications\
  \ and unique cases. Hence, we can NEVER be too sure. Therefore, this was one of\
  \ the most instrumental steps we had to set in motion in order to know if it's actually\
  \ working or not.</p>\n<p>Future tangible implementation scope: Mobile App or Web\
  \ App to be used in Clinics and Hospitals.</p>\n<p>(3) Tackling the problem of Model\
  \ Over-fitting:</p>\n<p>In this contribution, we try to mitigate the problem of\
  \ over-fitting to the greatest extent possible WITHOUT employing techniques such\
  \ as Cross-Validation. The reason behind taking the entire dataset at once is very\
  \ simple: Let's say you are dealing with a Binary-Class data with a huge class imbalance\
  \ problem. Cross-Validation will not let you manually select the number of images\
  \ that goes into each split that you make from each individual classes. It is also\
  \ important to mention that the randomisation process ain't so bad altogether however,\
  \ there's always room for improvements and alternate doors can also lead to better\
  \ destinations.</p>"
