  how to extract data from spreadsheets using Python.</p>
description: <p>How do you read data from Excel? How do you read data that has meaningful
  formats(rows or cells are colour coded)? Or pivot tables that need to be in tidy
  format? Or data with hierarchical formatting ? This talk will show how to use Pandas,
  Openpyxl, and some other make-life-easy tools to extract data from Excel into Python
  in a tidy form and proceed to the next phase of our data analysis.</p>
