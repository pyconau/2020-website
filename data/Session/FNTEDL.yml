abstract: <p>In this moderated panel, we'll hear from three experienced data science
  practitioners on how issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and misaligned incentives
  play out in their professional lives, as well as their perspectives on how we can
  actively work towards more ethical AI.</p>
description: "<p>As the fabric of civic infrastructure becomes increasingly digitised\
  \ and data-driven, and our lives are nudged in the direction of what is presented\
  \ as optimal many times a day, there is an increasing awareness of the importance\
  \ of ethical AI. Issues that have been called out in particular are: data privacy,\
  \ the harm that algorithmic bias can have, and the negative repercussions of unchecked\
  \ recommendation systems blindly maximising engagement.</p>\n<p>That ethical AI\
  \ has become part of the discourse of data and AI is a positive sign, but how do\
  \ we move from just talk? Who is responsible? What can you do about these issues?</p>\n\
  <p>In this moderated panel, we'll hear from three experienced data science practitioners\
  \ on how these issues play out in their professional lives, as well as their perspectives\
  \ on how we can actively work towards more ethical AI. </p>\n<p>We hope this discussion\
  \ will provide a valuable backdrop upon which to reflect throughout the rest of\
  \ the day as we cover a range of exciting topics in science, data, and analytics.</p>"
