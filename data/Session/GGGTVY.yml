abstract: "<p>The talk begins with introduction to deception technology, deception\
  \ types and methods, deceptive security life cycle. In this talk, we will demonstrate\
  \ the following deception tools implemented using python language:\n• WebTrap (https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap):\
  \ is designed to create deceptive webpages to deceive and redirect attackers away\
  \ from real websites. The deceptive webpages are generated by cloning real websites,\
  \ specifically their login pages.\n• DemonHunter (https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter):\
  \  is a distributed low interaction honeypot with Agent/Master design\nFinally,\
  \ we will conclude the talk with how built a deception tool and demonstrate its\
  \ working. We will demonstrate how our count-based validation technique combined\
  \ with the LSTM machine learning algorithm was used to protect from XPath injection\
  \ attacks. We will also demonstrate how deceiving attackers can be an effective\
  \ strategy in protecting resources.</p>"
description: "<p>Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and\
  \ you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from\
  \ them you start running and look for a safe place to hide yourself. On the way,\
  \ you will find a good person and request the person to help you. The person hides\
  \ you in the secure place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit\
  \ a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and\
  \ redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how\
  \ deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social\
  \ elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good\
  \ person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making\
  \ them fall in the trap.</p>\n<p><strong>How we implemented deception tool in python\
  \ using machine learning</strong>\nWe designed a deception tool in python language\
  \ using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services.\
  \ It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried\
  \ using XPath query language. XPath as a query language, it has injection issues\
  \ similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses count-based\
  \ validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks\
  \ to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user\
  \ input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the\
  \ critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in classification\
  \ of input vectors.</p>"
