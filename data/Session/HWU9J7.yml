abstract: "<p>Most of us have written python programs. Many have written modules.\
  \ Some have packaged and uploaded them to servers for distribution. And a significant\
  \ portion of these packages could be made better.</p>\n<p>I propose a talk expressing\
  \ the need for these tools and the advantage of using them with a toy python program\
  \ for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim\">Nim</a>.</p>"
description: "&lt;h4&gt;Why&lt;/h4&gt;\n<p>Most of the well established projects follow\
  \ some practices and has some mechanism in place to ensure better maintainability.</p>\n\
  <p>But we can find a good number of packages online which are being developed without\
  \ an equivalent mechanism.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will mention some tools, which\
  \ when used, can lay the foundation for a well formed package.</p>\n&lt;h4&gt;Well-formed\
  \ package&lt;/h4&gt;\n<p>A package whose source has some structure which makes testing\
  \ and development more efficient and less error-prone.</p>\n<p>Such a package also\
  \ makes working with its source a more pleasant experience.</p>\n<p>A well-formed\
  \ package makes things easier for both the developer and the user.</p>\n<p>But it\
  \ is easier to get started with a structure than to maintain that form. Which calls\
  \ for a mechanism to maintain that structure.</p>\n&lt;h4&gt;How&lt;/h4&gt;\n<p>The\
  \ source code should adopt a style and stick with it. A linting tool like pylint\
  \ can help with it.\nOr you could use black.</p>\n<p>Use type annotations along\
  \ with tools like mypy.</p>\n<p>Eliminate unused code with <code>vulture</code>.</p>\n\
  <p>Add tests to be sure that the different functionalities work as intended using\
  \ tools like pytest or the built-in unittest.\nThis will be extremely useful to\
  \ be sure that further modifications do not break existing code.</p>\n<p>Ensure\
  \ proper test coverage with coverage.py\nAfter all, adding tests isn't everything.\
  \ One got to make sure it reaches every nook and corner.</p>\n<p>Automate tests\
  \ with tox, nox, etc.</p>\n<p>Package the project in tune with the future of packaging.\n\
  setuptools, flit or poetry</p>\n<p>And add some CI/CD.</p>\n<p>Other tools like\
  \ pre-commit, bumpversion, etc may also be used.</p>\n&lt;h4&gt;Intended audience&lt;/h4&gt;\n\
  <p>People who create and publish python packages.\nThe presentation is from the\
  \ package developer's perspective and not exactly about the innards of the different\
  \ python packaging tools.</p>\n&lt;h4&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/h4&gt;\n<p>Basic Python\
  \ programming.\nGit</p>\n<h2>Tentative talk outline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Linting</li>\n\
