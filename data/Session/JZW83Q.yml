abstract: <p>I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open
  source contribution was in summer of 2016. Pretty soon I found myself being given
  commit rights to other people’s open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer
  brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk,
  I will share my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way, and some advice
  for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.</p>
