abstract: "<p>We're used to thinking of source code as text, and thinking of \"coding\"\
  \ as\nmanipulating source files with text editors, but there are other ways to\n\
  think about programming.</p>\n<p>What assumptions from 50 years ago are holding\
  \ us back today?</p>"
description: "<p>We'll explore the history of typewriters and find homoiconicity where\
  \ you might not\nbe expecting it.</p>\n<p>We'll talk about structured data and explore\
  \ the early visions of hypertext.</p>\n<p>We'll look at some specific examples of\
  \ unusual programming environments \nand consider how a fresh look at these ideas\
  \ can be applied to modern development.</p>\n<p>And finally we'll consider what\
  \ a difference this could make to the work of programming.</p>"
