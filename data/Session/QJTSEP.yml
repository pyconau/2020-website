abstract: "<p>It feels like it should be easy, but its not... you think, “it shouldn't\
  \ take too long“, wrong again.\nThis talk is about some things you should think\
  \ about/read about/know about as you dive into geospatial data. It will present\
  \ some tools, videos, websites, etc, which might be useful as you forge your own\
  \ path on the map of possibilities. Just an overall solid 25 minutes of geo-goodnes...\
  \ with python!\nThe aim of this talk is to inspire you to cross over to the geospatial\
  \ side of data if you have not already, to give you some pointers if you are on\
  \ your way, and to make you laugh/sigh at all the stuff you have had to learn to\
  \ be where you are if you have been at it for a while.</p>"
description: "<p>Here is my top level summary:\n- its hard for everyone, you are not\
  \ alone. \n- snacks:\n  - points, lines and polygons\n  - projections (<em>scream\
  \ quietly into the void</em>)\n  - WKT\n  - file types\n  - \"simple\" calculations\n\
  - pantry:\n  - libraries\n  - useful stuff on the internet\n  - quick wins\n  -\
  \ other software\n  - debugging\n- dinner:\n  - interesting problems\n  - other\
  \ fun things</p>"
