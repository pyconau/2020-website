abstract: <p>A story of a construction project manager who fell into the deep world
  of Django and Python</p>
description: "<p>Are you from a non-tech industry but want to learn web development?\
  \ Have you tried doing the official Django tutorial and had no idea what was going\
  \ on?</p>\n<p>This talk is a story about how I learnt Django and Python coming from\
  \ a non-tech industry, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will cover tips for beginners\
  \ on how best to get started with Django and Python.</p>\n<p>I will be sharing about\
  \ mistakes that I made, resources that I found useful, and how I created connections\
  \ both online and offline. I will finish off with comparing the tech and construction\
  \ industry and my belief that exciting things can happen when they learn from each\
  \ other.</p>"
