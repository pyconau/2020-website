abstract: <p>This presentation explores a year 12 Internet of Things project in which
  students had to design a maze-solving robot that could save victims from a hypothetical
  fire. The robot was built using Lego but using a Raspberry Pi micro-controller.
  The Raspberry Pi hosted a Flask web server that interacted with the robot and saved
  sensor data to an SQLite database. Students had to design and create all components
  of the project and create an effective web interface to the robot. Some students
  even enhanced their projects with a voice synthesizer and a Pi Cam to provide a
  live video stream.</p>
