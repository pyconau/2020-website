abstract: <p>Command-line applications and interfaces are used by both newcomers and
  experienced Python developers everyday. But do you know how they came to be? Hop
  on to this ship as we go through the CLI galaxy and look at its history, explore
  the CLI anatomy and discover some Python packages that can help us create them.
  We’ll then emulate one of the most popular CLIs of our time by writing our own CLI
  using Click, and see how we can package it and publish it on PyPI. Are you ready
  to travel faster-than-light using this ship’s Infinite Improbability Drive? Carry
  your towel!</p>
