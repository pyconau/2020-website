description: "<p>As health authorities raced against the clock to restrict the spread\
  \ of the Novel Coronavirus, bringing cities to a standstill, software developers\
  \ too were racing to build a technological innovation. Their solution was ⁎✧˚₊ an\
  \ app ༚⁎✧⁺  that would mystically allow you once again to go to the footy, hang\
  \ out in pubs, return to work, and re-open the economy.</p>\n<p>With the Australian\
  \ Government running an unprecedented campaign to get as many people as possible\
  \ to download their particular app, what this app actually does is still widely\
  \ misunderstood. Furthermore, the app is somehow supposed to be safe and protect\
  \ your privacy, whilst still being useful enough to track you and provide that information\
  \ to medical contact tracers. How can that even work?</p>\n<p>In this talk we will:\n\
  - discover what contact-tracing is and why it is vital to curb the spread of the\
  \ coronavirus\n- explore how technology can be used to assist in the contact-tracing\
  \ process\n- analyze the COVIDSafe mobile apps for iOS and Android,\n- discuss why\
  \ you should, or shouldn’t, install COVIDSafe, and how contact-tracing apps try\
  \ to balance personal security and privacy with the health needs of the greater\
  \ community</p>\n<p>Those who attend this talk will learn about bluetooth-assisted\
  \ contact tracing, exposure notification, and the shiny new new COVID-19 settings\
  \ on their mobile phone</p>"
