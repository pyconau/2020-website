abstract: "<p>System Packages, pip install --user, virtualenv and conda. We have never\
  \ had so many ways to install python packages, and yet it is becoming increasingly\
  \ hard to tell exactly where all the packages you depend on are coming from and\
  \ even harder to reproduce the same package setup twice.</p>\n<p>In this talk we'll\
  \ learn how Nix package manager can provide a complete dependency management solution\
  \ for python projects. Setting up isolated, reproducible development and build environments\
  \ can be easy and fun, and can even directly generate incredibly svelte docker images\
  \ with ease.</p>"
description: "<p>Scientists, Researchers and Software Engineering projects should\
  \ be paying attention to the reproducibility of their results. The best way to guarantee\
  \ that the project you build today will be the same when built next week is to exactly\
  \ specify your dependency tree. </p>\n<p>Imperative package management approaches\
  \ (such as apt/pip/conda) provide few assurances that the package version you get\
  \ today is the same version you'll get tomorrow, or that installing packages in\
  \ a different order won't change the versions resolved. The problem gets even harder\
  \ when you want to integrate with native extensions that rely on platform libraries\
  \ and the ephemeral contents of /usr/share/. </p>\n<p>In this talk I'll discuss\
  \ how Nix package manager can provide a complete dependency management solution\
  \ for python projects on Linux and Mac. Nix can install and track exact, reproducible\
  \ versions of python packages and their transitive dependencies including platform\
  \ libraries, down to the compiler version that created them. No more guessing why\
  \ your teammate can trigger a bug that you can't reproduce.</p>\n<p>Nix can use\
  \ this dependency info to quickly get new teammates up and running with a full development\
  \ environment, no worries about the setup instructions being out of date or incompatible\
  \ with their chosen OS flavor. Finally, Nix can build your project in a sealed build\
  \ environment that prevents your project sneakily including files that haven't been\
  \ declared as dependencies. You can then confidently deploy these builds as minimal\
  \ docker images, VM images, or directly via nix package caches.</p>"
