abstract: <p>You may know dunder init (<code>__init__</code>), but how well do you
  know about other Python “magic” functions? Why are dunder functions not accessible?
  in this talk, I am going to show you the secrets of the Dunder functions and what
  purposes they have. Once the mystery is solved, we will see the beauty of those
  functions.</p>
description: "<p>At the start, we will be using <code>dir</code> to look into the\
  \ secret functions Python objects have. Eg:\n<code>__getitem__</code>, <code>__iter__</code>\
  \ and <code>__next__</code> Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function\
  \ goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions\
  \ can change the identity of the Python objects.</p>\n<p>This talk is for attendees\
  \ who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and\
  \ the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why\
  \ Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully,\
  \ this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.</p>"
