abstract: <p>Have you ever heard “You have to be this tall to operate a mobile phone?”.
  Programming for diversity serves as an unquestionable indicator that your software
  embraces and cares about your users’ safety and comfort. Join me on a thought-provoking
  look at how you can program with Python for Accessibility.</p>
description: "<p>My life is a hilarious roller coaster of miss-intended programming\
  \ bugs because at 4 foot tall and 50 kilograms I completely fall off your radar.</p>\n\
  <p>Why did my scale call me! Why does facial recognition see me as a child? These\
  \ are all valid questions I often ask myself as I navigate my weird and different\
  \ world. Have you heard the phrase “You have to be this tall for Micro-services”?\
  \ well what about: “You have to be this tall to operate a mobile phone?”. I am finding\
  \ it harder and harder to reach any button except for “#” and “9”.</p>\n<p>Building\
  \ accessibility into the planning stages of programming can eliminate barriers for\
  \ participation and create an inclusive environment for people with disabilities.\
  \ Programming for diversity serves as an unquestionable indicator that your software\
  \ embraces the diversity of your users and cares about their safety and comfort.</p>\n\
  <p>Join me on a fascinating and thought-provoking look at how you can program for\
  \ Accessibility with Python.</p>"
