abstract: "<p>The Zen of Python, the well known list of 20 Python aphorisms (of which\
  \ only 19 are written down), contains a lot of prescriptive advice for what makes\
  \ \"Good\" Python code… or it would, if one of them didn't give you permission to\
  \ ignore the rest of them.</p>\n<p>Focusing on one piece of the 19 aphorisms, this\
  \ talk explores the contradictions in the Zen of Python's advice, and how even with\
  \ prescriptive rules, writing \"Good\" Python remains a subjective exercise.</p>"
description: "<p>When you type “import this” into a Python interpreter, you get PEP-20,\
  \ 20* aphorisms that describe what “Good” Python code looks like. Most of these\
  \ are prescriptive, and have been used to settle countless arguments about how Python\
  \ should grow, or how new ideas should be implemented.</p>\n<p>But in these 20 aphorisms\
  \ (which you may know as the “Zen of Python”), there are some inherent contradictions.\
  \ </p>\n<p>When “explicit is better than implicit” and “simple is better than complex”,\
  \ what does it mean when being explicit means you must introduce complexity? </p>\n\
  <p>When “readability counts” and “special cases aren’t special enough to break the\
  \ rules”, what does it mean when making code more readable presents a special case\
  \ in your codebase?</p>\n<p>The answer lies in one often-forgotten aphorism: “practicality\
  \ beats purity”. When you can weigh practicality as a factor, you can decide that\
  \ other factors are restrictive, and discard them as “impractical”. This idea shows\
  \ up in many places in Python:</p>\n<p>Type hints can help you to be explicit, but\
  \ they introduce complexity. Focusing on practicality means you can adopt type hints\
  \ only when you need them. Decorators are simple, but can be used to introduce ambiguity.\
  \ In many cases, the practical benefits of decorators outweigh their potential for\
  \ misuse.</p>\n<p>But how far can the pursuit of practicality let you go? Does practicality\
  \ let you treat the other 19 aphorisms as optional? Does practicality give you an\
  \ escape hatch from the rest of the Zen of Python? </p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll\
  \ look at how practicality has been a guiding principle in the evolution of Python.\
  \ We’ll look at how to weigh practicality in the face of the other 19 aphorisms\
  \ of PEP-20, and we’ll look at how focusing on practicality can guide you towards\
  \ these other attributes of good Python.</p>\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n<p>(* per PEP-20, the\
  \ Zen of Python contains “20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.”)</p>"
