abstract: "<p>At some point, every engineer has to decide whether to write tests or\
  \ ship the feature and move on. Testing code that uses S3 is often overlooked. But\
  \ think of all the important things your application uses S3 for! Metadata storage,\
  \ logs, and static file hosting, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Testing code that uses S3\
  \ is really easy. This talk goes over three ways to test S3 and leaves you with\
  \ code examples that you can take to your next project.</p>"
