abstract: "<p>This year has felt like we fell into a strange land, full of new rules,\
  \ new dangers, things the wrong size. But unlike Alice on her trip through the looking\
  \ glass, we have company, and we have community. </p>\n<p>Python, more than any\
  \ other programming language I can think of, is full of people who identify themselves\
  \ as part of a community, and we can use that identity to accomplish so much. What\
  \ is the \"style guide\" of a Pythonista, how are they equipped, what do they see\
  \ when they look in a mirror? Who are you going to be this year?</p>"
description: <p>This talk is for anyone who feels alone, sitting in front of a monitor,
  with a mask hung on the door to the outside. Technology can't solve all our problems,
  and we shouldn't try, but the collective action of aligned communities can change
  the world. What has the Python community done, and what can we work on doing next?
  Where should we spend our resources, and how should we agree on priorities? What
  is investing in our present and what is for our future?</p>
