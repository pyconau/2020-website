abstract: <p>In this talk, a math equation will be given as a benchmark. Instead of
  optimizing it with Cython (painful and unpythonic), I will give three Pythonic solutions
  to accelerate NumPy. At the end, the pros and cons of three solutions will be given
  as well as some recommendations based on my experience.</p>
description: "<p>If you've been a data scientist or researcher long enough, you must\
  \ have encountered a situation where your NumPy code ran quickly on small datasets\
  \ in a testing environment but performed poorly on real-world datasets (100x larger\
  \ or more). In this talk, I will introduce three Pythonic solutions to improve NumPy\
  \ performance drastically without modifying too many codes.</p>\n<p>At the beginning\
  \ of the talk, a math equation: logsumexp, which is widely used in machine learning,\
  \ will be illustrated. I will show how it is implemented with pure NumPy and use\
  \ it as a benchmark so we can compare it to three proposed solutions at the end\
  \ of the talk.</p>\n<p>Then, three solutions: CuPy, Numba, and Pythran will be presented\
  \ in separate sections. In each section, I will give a brief introduction to the\
  \ solution and show how to apply this solution to our benchmark code.</p>\n<p>At\
  \ the end of the talk, I will compare these solutions from different aspects:</p>\n\
  &lt;pre&gt;<code>* How much performance is boosted after each solution is applied\n\
  * Ease to apply on your existing code (including the ease of debugging)\n* Limitations\
  \ of each solution\n* Which solution should be applied first in given scenarios\n\
  </code>&lt;/pre&gt;\n<p>Last but not the least, I will show a relatively new but\
  \ interesting solution: Transonic to the audience so they can give it a try on their\
  \ side project.</p>"
