abstract: <p>In 2017 I came one keypress from causing Google's main backbone to largely
  fall off the Internet. This is the story of how we used that incident as a learning
  opportunity, how a lack of buy-in hindered further improvements, and how an existing
  toolkit of python libraries allowed testing and validation tools to be quickly built,
  preventing any chance of a recurrence.</p>
