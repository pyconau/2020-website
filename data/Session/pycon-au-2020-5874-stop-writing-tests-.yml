abstract: "<p>Tests can be helpful: they can find bugs in new code, check for regressions\
  \ in old code, and clarify precisely what the code is meant to do.  On the other\
  \ hand, writing tests is often tedious - and it's rare to think of an error when\
  \ testing that you forgot when writing the code.</p>\n<p>My solution?  Use tools\
  \ that write tests for you!</p>\n<p>Whether you're a novice Pythonista or gnarled\
  \ wizard, this talk about property-based fuzzing and code introspection will educate,\
  \ entertain, and help take your testing to the next level.</p>"
description: "<p>We often think of manual testing as slower and less effective than\
  \ automated testing,\nbut most test suites haven't automated that much!  Computers\
  \ can execute all our \npre-defined tests very quickly - and this is definitely\
  \ a good thing, especially for \nregression tests - but the tricky parts are still\
  \ done by humans.</p>\n<p>We select test cases (inputs) and check that the corresponding\
  \ outputs make sense;\nwe write functions that \"arrange, act, and assert\" for\
  \ our tests; and we decide -\nor script via CI systems - which tests to execute\
  \ and when.</p>\n<p>So lets explore some next-generation tools that we could use\
  \ to automate these \nremaining parts of a testing workflow!</p>\n<p>PROPERTY-BASED\
  \ TESTING helps you to write more powerful tests by automating selection \nof test\
  \ cases: instead of listing input-output pairs, you describe the kind of data \n\
  you want and write a test that passes <em>for all X...</em>.  We'll see a live demo,\
  \ and \nlearn something about the Python builtins in the process!</p>\n<p>CODE INTROSPECTION,\
  \ and a handy templating tool, can help write tests for you.\nDo you need to know\
  \ any more than which code to test, and what properties should hold?</p>\n<p>ADAPTIVE\
  \ FUZZING tools take CI to its logical conclusion: instead of running a fixed\n\
  set of tests on each push, they sit on a server and run tests full-time... fine-tuning\n\
  themselves to find bugs in <em>your</em> project and pulling each new commit as\
  \ it lands!</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk, you'll know what these three kinds\
  \ of tools can do - \nand how to get started with automating the <em>rest</em> of\
  \ your testing tomorrow.</p>"
