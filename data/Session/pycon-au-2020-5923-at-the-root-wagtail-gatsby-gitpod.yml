abstract: <p>Headless Wagtail + GatsbyJS Progressive Web App Generator - in the style
  of modern static site generations, pre-fetched to provide a speed and performance.
  Can I build something really cool, quickly? We have the power of two of the most
  popular frameworks, proven to scale with some of the largest software products in
  the world.</p>
description: "<p>Exploring if a GatsbyJS progressive web app generator frontend with\
  \ a headless Wagtail backend could be a solution for small-sized clients and personal\
  \ projects when I want to \"whip something up\" quickly without sacrificing design,\
  \ performance/hosting costs, user or site editor experience (Can I have it all)?\
  \ Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a open source framework based on React.\
  \ Wagtail (https://wagtail.io/) is a Django CMS with LOTS of cool features for content\
  \ creators, and \"plays nicely with everything else in your tech stack\" (source:\
  \ Wagtail) because its built on and easily integrates with all uses of Python. </p>\n\
  <p>Why? Not only do I enjoy the new and shiny things as a consultant, both Wagtail\
  \ and GatsbyJS are established frameworks and active communities that put considerable\
  \ effort in providing a great product with a smooth developer experience. We enjoy\
  \ the benefits of Django / Wagtail CMS, with a incredibly fast pre-fetched progressive\
  \ web app with GatsbyJS. The goal is nice, fast and fun. </p>\n<p>I am approaching\
  \ this talk by walking through how I started out with minimal experience with GatsbyJS\
  \ or GraphQL, and moderate experience with React and headless Wagtail to creating\
  \ and deploying (Netlify) this app. I am not an expert in either technology, but\
  \ was able to quickly navigate getting started as well as identify lots of resources\
  \ in both communities to build out in a more complex experience.</p>"
