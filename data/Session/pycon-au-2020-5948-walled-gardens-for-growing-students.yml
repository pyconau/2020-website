abstract: <p>How can we create environments for students to learn programming skills
  that allow them to thrive without overwhelming them?</p>
description: "<p>Creating learning environments for teaching students programming\
  \ and cyber security skills is hard.\nDo we give them professional software engineering\
  \  environments? They'll learn something \"real\" but they will likely only understand\
  \ a fraction of the context.\nDo we use a small, safe educational environment?\n\
  They'll understand all of the concepts, but they may be hard to translate into practical,\
  \ open-ended projects and they'll never learn to thrive.</p>\n<p>How can we select\
  \ or craft environments that give us the best of both worlds?</p>"
