    Hi folks.
</p>
<p>
    As you might have guessed, PyCon AU will not be held at the Adelaide Convention Centre this August. Instead, we’re going to be holding <b>PyConline AU</b> which will be, as the name suggests, an online event.
</p>
<p>
    PyCon AU is two things. It is an excellent, high quality educational event that brings Pythonistas together to teach and learn from each other, but it is also an important social event where genuine and valuable friendships are made and strengthened. The team and I are going to spend the next few months doing as much as we can to bring both of those facets to an online event. We’re still discussing ideas for exactly how, but it’s really important to us that PyConline is more than just a really long webinar.
</p>
<p>
    This is also going to be a difficult and unpredictable few months for all of us. But an online event gives us a lot more flexibility compared to an in person event. Whether you’re presenting, running a track, or on the core team, one thing we absolutely do not want is for you to feel like you’re letting the team down, simply because you need to look after yourself or those you love. So we’re going to use that flexibility to structure the event so that whatever your role, whenever you need to, you can do what you need, and the show will go on.
</p>
<p>
    I also want to thank the core team for being awesome, the PyCon AU Steering Committee and Linux Australia Council for having our backs, the Adelaide Convention Centre for being great to work with in a difficult time, and Buildkite for sponsoring PyCon AU 2020 early and sticking with us for PyConline AU.
</p>
<p>

    To end on a positive note, I want to tell you about the things that are coming up next!
</p>
